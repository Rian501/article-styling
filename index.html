			<h2>Day One Reflections</h2>
			<section>
				<p>I have the impression that all of these things are words I have heard before, and ideas I have encountered, but just barely, like light brushes with concepts with no previous need for deep understanding.</p>
				<p>I feel also like there are a lot of things I learned in the prework I did manage to do, but I only learned it in a sort of superficial way because I'm not really able to reproduce it without looking up every single thing. I also feel the need to get my work checked. I am not sure if this is good practice or just a natural desire for validation. Will monitor going forward.</p>

			<h2>Day Two Reflections</h2>
			<section>
				<p>My initial feelings of being swamped are a bit mitigated. There is a lot of surface-scratching, inevitable but difficult to feel satisfied with, but I'm just tuning in the way I actually tend to do best. Instead of frantically trying to cover everything and have all the details in order, I should try to just get the concept, because the notes are availalbe and if I can get to where I can figure out the path back to them, I'll be fine.</p>

				<p>Eheu, alas for not having finished all the prework. I wish that I had, for I feel behind. I would probably still feel lost even having done it all, but I would feel more secure that lost was the right place to be.</p>

			<h2>Day Three Reflections</h2>

				<p>On this day, I had a wreck on my way to school, and was therefore absent.</p>

			<h2>Day Four Reflections</h2>
			<section>
			<p>On this day, I was still recovering from the concussion I got in the wreck, so I stayed home to "avoid doing anything taxing either physically or mentally".</p>

			<h2>Day Five Reflections</h2>
			<p>Today I am back at school. I feel more behind than ever before! But I am trying to go easy on the frustration with that. My brain feels like it is actually moving slower than I am used to, and it takes me longer to remember things, and I am more forgetful. I am blaming this on the concussion and hoping it is temporary, so that I can get back to being the self I remember. But, I am also trying to remind myself to be patient, especially now, because being impatient is only going to make me stressed out, and is not actually going to help me work any faster. Still, it's counterintuitive to me to catch up by taking it slow, to advance by resting.</p>

			<p>This week has been pretty rough. I'm enjoying the group project, but am a bit anxious about all the work I feel behind in. I know I have to give myself a break and go at a reasonable pace, even to slow it down more than I would typically think of as a reasonable pace, but it is my usual way to prefer trying to race ahead.</p>
			<p>Today I was able to make a nav bar for our group product page, and our group was also able to navigate (apparently the hard way of) resolving changes with merging branches in github. A week ago, although I had a github account and had gone through the small tutorial of branching and merging a branch with myself, I really had no idea what github was or how it worked. Now I have some idea. I had also never made an HTML page from scratch, even an ugly one, nor had I made a nav bar, even a somewhat clunky one. I had watched some Treehouse videos, but I had never actually made anything on my own or with others from a blank file. So, while I still feel lost and behind, there's been progress this week.</p>
			<p>I will try to do some work over the weekend, but also to rest, and deal with things like insurance and other headaches that come from the same source as, though not only directly from, the concussion.</p>

			<p>It is now Friday again, and I am feeling a little more confident, a little less lost, and a lot happier. I freaking hate my life outside of school right now (dealing with insurance companies, not having transportation, etc.), but within the school walls and hours I find that I really enjoy learning all this new stuff and trying to make it work. Every bug fix feels like a revelation and a triumph.</p>
			<p>I used to stress about school, and have anxiety about being behind. I felt that way last week, too, because the exercise list coupled with my remaining pre-work basically convinced me that I was a loser and potentially irredeemable as far as hoping to make enough progress to 'get there' by the end of the course. I feel a lot calmer about it now. I think the constant emphasis on growth over achievement is helping.</p>
